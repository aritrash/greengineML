Hello there!
This is a simple IoT - Embedded Systems project regarding how to detect artificial lighting (LED, Fluroscent or any other electrical / heat light source other than the sun) from natural lighting. This system finds its usage in automatic lighting and appliances management systems.
This uses <b> Logistic Regression </b> algorithms to take input from an LDR ADC values, and OpenWeatherAPI's Weather API to get exact sunset and sunrise times for our system to work and give a boolean output prediction of if there is any artificial light present.
